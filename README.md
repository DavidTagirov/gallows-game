# The Gallows Game  

**Gallows** is a classic word-guessing game where the player must uncover a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time.  

## Rules of the Game  
- The program selects a random noun.  
- The player enters a letter that might be in the word.  
- If the letter is present, it appears in the correct positions.  
- If the letter is absent, one part of the hangman is drawn (6 parts in total: head, torso, 2 arms, 2 legs).  
- The game continues until:  
  - The player successfully guesses the entire word (**Victory**)  
  - The hangman is fully drawn (**Defeat**)
