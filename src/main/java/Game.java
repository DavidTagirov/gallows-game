                The rules of the game:
                    The program writes a random existing noun word.
                    The player enters a letter that can be included in this word. If there is such a letter in a word,
                    then the program writes it over the corresponding lines of this letter â€” as many times as it occurs
                    in the word. If there is no such letter, then a circle in a loop representing the head is added to
                    the gallows.
                    The player continues to guess the letters until he guesses the whole word. For each incorrect answer,
                    one part of the torso is added to the gallows (There are 6 of them in total: the head, torso, 2 arms and 2 legs).
                    If the torso in the gallows is completely drawn, then the guessing player loses, and is considered hanged.
                    If the player manages to guess the word, he wins.
